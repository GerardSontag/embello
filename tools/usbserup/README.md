# USB Serial Uploader

Before building this, place a copy of the `libopencm3` folder in this dir.  
It works with this one: <https://github.com/libopencm3/libopencm3-examples>  
Does not work yet with latest code in `libopencm3` itself, for some reason.

This code started off as the [USB CDC-ACM][1] example code on GitHub.  
License: LGPL3, like [libopencm3][2] + [libopencm3-example][3] it's based on.
